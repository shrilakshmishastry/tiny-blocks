## Agenda

- Build small components for fun
- Experiment with it

## Notes

- Use storybook: as it's individual components, it's flexible to use storybook. It reduces the effort on implementing UI and writing doc

## Components

- Feedback card

## TODO

- add url import shorthand setting in ts.config
- performance effect on importing index.css in every component
- eslint
- add github action
